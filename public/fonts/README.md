# Self-hosted fonts

To use the **Outfit** font offline (no Google Fonts request):

1. Download from [Google Fonts – Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) (click “Download family”).
2. Unzip and copy **`Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf`** into this folder (`public/fonts/`).

The app will then load Outfit from your server; build and runtime work without external font requests.
